# I Am Here (Donâ€™t Sleep)

I Am Here is a small app that sits in the right side of your menu bar. Its single purpose is to prevent your screen from going into standby when you don't want it to.

I Am Here predicts when your screen is about to sleep. It activates the webcam moments before your screen goes blank. If it detects that someone is sitting in front of the computer then the screen will stay on. I Am Here uses face detection to determine whether someone is sitting in front of the computer.

You can also instruct I Am Here to postpone standby by a number of minutes or hours, or to never let your computer sleep.
